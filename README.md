## What is Big Ω?
Big Ω (Big Omega) is a browser extension which enhances your experience while you are solving coding problems online on various competitive programming websites like Leetcode

★ Company Tags

★ Question list for a specific Company
- Provides the company wise list of problems upon click of any specific company tag.

## Running extention locally
- Go to `chrome://extentions`
- Toggle developer mode on top right in order to enable it
- Click Load unpacked and choose the `build` folder in root of this project
- Your extention is loaded sucessfully, you don't even need to click it, just go to any leetcode problem and extention will start working

## How to build locally
  For Mac:
- Clone project
- Open in any editor of your choice
- If you want to add/remove code then react code is present under `src/`, which you can edit
- Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
- Now run `npm run build` to create a loadable build/ folder
- Now to actually test changes we need to load the extention in browser so go to `chrome://extensions` through browser searchbar
- Toggle developer mode on top right in order to enable it
- Click Load unpacked and choose the `build` folder in root of this project
- Your extention is loaded sucessfully, you don't even need to click it, just go to any leetcode problem and extention will start working
  
For Windows: 
- Clone project
- Open in any editor of your choice
- If you want to add/remove code then react code is present under `src/`, which you can edit
- Replace the `scripts` part in `package.json` file to the below mentioned one
```
"scripts": {
          "start": "react-scripts start",
          "zip-build": "bestzip big-omega-extension.zip build/",
          "move-files": "copy leetcode-live.zip ../webapp/public",
          "test": "react-scripts test",
          "eject": "react-scripts eject",
          "build": "set INLINE_RUNTIME_CHUNK=false && node ./build-rewired.js && npm run clean && npm run move-index",
          "clean": "cd build && move static\\js\\*.js big-omega-tools.js && move static\\css\\*.css big-omega-tools.css",
          "move-index": "copy public\\index.html build\\index.html"
        },
```
- Now Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
- Run `npm run build` to create a loadable build/ folder
- Now to actually test changes we need to load the extention in browser so go to `chrome://extentions` through browser searchbar
